This exercise is part of the Spring Boot Intro lecture.

It contains:

* An introduction to Spring Data (two sample entities)
* Configuration of the database connection (application.yml)
* Sample hello world controller
* Some exteriments with Spring Beans in the zoo package

The "project" does not make much sence without the lecture itself.
