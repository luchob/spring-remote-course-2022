This exercise is part of the Spring MCV Intro lecture.

Here you can find a very basic application
with a sample controller that is able to support CRUD 
(create, read, update and delete) operations for cats.

This is a very basic MVC application:

* controller - ``CatController``
* model - ``CatDTO``
* views - all the HTML thymeleaf templates in the ``templates`` folder
